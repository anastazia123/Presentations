# DataFest Workshop 2016

Presentation to undergraduates to prep for this years DataFest. Topics I plan on covering:

- Methods for reading in data (`base` vs. `readr` package).
- Deciphering data description files.
- Joining, cleaning and forming data (`dplyr` and `tidyr`).
- Saving/writing data for easy sharing.
